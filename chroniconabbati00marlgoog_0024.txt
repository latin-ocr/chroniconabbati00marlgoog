§ 6. Au earlier and independent life of S. ngin,
which as yet has never been printed, is preserved in a
MS. of the tenth or eleventh century iu the British

Muscam, Cotton, Nero, E. 1, and has hitherto passed

this name, however, no contemporary authority appears

graphica by various authors), nor is it elsewhere
notioed; it is only assigned in a heading prefixed by
a modern hand, and probably was a mere conjecture
from the circumstance mentioned in ngin's foundation·

lise appears to have been tho only one known to late

“ Nova Legenda Angliae” (fol. Lond. 1516, ff. 123-

agrees with that in all the points (save one) in which
thaprior's life differs from the earlier document, aud
while Lelaud also seems to have derived from the
same source the notes “ ex libro de miraculis S.
