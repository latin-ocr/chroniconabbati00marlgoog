count of abbot Norreys' conduct between 1191 and
1200 is evidently given by one who was an inmate of
the monastery 11 1111 time. Marleberge must, therefore,
have been connected with 1111 abbey iu some capacity
for 1 considerable period before his actual profession,
possibly during 1 lengthened noviciate3 and the date l
of his death, 1236, renders this the more likely. His
own previous studies appear 1ο have been carried on 11 ”
Ρ1111, since he tells us that he (together with Richard ,
Ροο11, afterwards dean and bishop of Salisbury) had
been the scholar of none other 111111 Stephen Langton,
who before his creation 11 cardinal was a distinguished
teacher in that University. Of Marleberge himself it

is said 11111 111 subsequently, but before becoming a
monk, lectured at Oxford and Exeter, in what was 1111
own especial branch of study, namely law, civil and
1111111 (p. 267).¹ In this faculty he himself tells us
11111 111 was well skilled (p. 117), and the course cf bis
narrative affords sufficient proof that herein he made
no vain boast. Nor did he in later years neglect op·
portunities for improvement; for when iu 11151111
molaria of Rome compelled him to leave that city and
retire to Bologna‚ we hear that 111 there spent six
mouths 111 attending daily lectures in both branchos
of jurisprudcnce (p. 147). On his appoiutmcnt to .-
be prior he gave to the abbey library a large
collection of books in law, medicine, philosophy,
poctry, theology, and grammar.2 That he should,
