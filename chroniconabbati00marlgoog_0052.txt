Heming is tube believed, Agelwy's acquisition ought
not in this case to be reckoned among his “ bene
“ gata;” for the former tella us (vol i. pp. 269-70)
that the laud in question waa held by one AErngrim¹

under Worcester, but in consequence of Urso d’Abetot ,

having unjustly seized other land belonging to that
cbnrch at the' same place, AErngrim had recourse to
Agelwy as the most poweriul patron he could secure,
and, renouncing Worceeter, paid suit and service for
hia land to the abbot of Evesham. The latter, however,
soon contrived, by means of tricka and artifices, to
cust AErngrim altogether, and, although all the neigh·
bours cried out upon the injustice of his act, his
power and eloquence (which made even the N ormana sear
him) soon silenced these. Heming goes on to say that
thie method oi acquiring property by crafty pretences
was notat all uncommon with Agelwy3 and that he
was hence continually engaged in disputes with his
friend bishop Wulstan, who, being an earnest soldier ι
of God, was no match for Agelwy in worldly wisdom,
whence it happened that many lande and houses were
lost by Worcester to Evesharn. But after hgelwy’s death,
upon Wulstan's beginning to offer special and earnest
prayers for the repose of his soul, the latter was im·
mediately attached by a most violent fit of gout, (the
disease from which the abbot had died) from which
he was warned by a divine revelation that he could not
reoover until he ceased his prayers. Acting upon this
intimation‚ he was, without the help oi medicine,
restored in a few days Hence the embittered Wigor-
