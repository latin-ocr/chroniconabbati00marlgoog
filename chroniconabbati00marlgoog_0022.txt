ξ 3. Of the three books into which the Chronicle is
divided, the first two, which eontain the Life and
Miracles of S. ngin (excepting the Legend for the
festivales tho Translation), written in the ordinary
verbose aud grandiloquent style of hagiographers, are
assigned in the rubrios at their head to prior Dominio.
These, that writer tells us (p. 2.), he wrote at the
request of his brethrcn3 but almost tho next generation
that followed appears to have grown sufficiently weary
of the worthy prior's prolixity to roquest Marleberge
to curtail it to more readahle proportione (pp. 27-8).
Professcdly “ebridged,'' as Dominic's work now is, hy
the hand os tho latter, there is sufficient evidence still
left to show that, in the glories of his subject, the
author hod indeed lost all thought of the “fastidiosi
“ auditores ’' whose better teste Marleberge sought to
consult

ξ 4. There ean bo no doubt that the history of
the Translation and Miracles of S. Odulph and the
anecdotos of several members of the ebbcy, which are
printed in the Appendix to the present volume, are
also the work of Dominio. The sounding declamatory
verbiage in which he dclights, and which forms suoh
a marked contrast to the more matter-of-faet style of
his successor, would of itself almost unmistakeably
essert his claim; but at p. 320 we are expressly told
that the writer of the Miraeles ol Odulph was the
same as the biographer of ngin. We learn also, from
tho same passage, that Dominio was the author ofa
third tract of a similer diameter, via, an account of
, Miracles wrought by the Blessed Virgin, which eom-
menced with the words “AEterna Dei sapientio.”
Possibly, also, the Life of S. Wistan, although in its
present shape it is tho work of Marlebcrge, may (as
its style would in some degree suggest) have been
founded on some previous memoir hy Dominio, which
Marlebcrge may have used and enlarged (see p. 27),
